- [ ] Add despawn_entity
- [ ] Remove temp allocator usage from modules where reasonable
- [ ] Add comments for craete_<struct_name> procs on structs
- [ ] Review all symbol scopes. Prefix intenal things with "_"
- [ ] Compute normal matrix directly
- [ ] Use orphaning
- [ ] Grow the buffer data only when needed
- [ ] Use min/mag filter from GLTF
- [ ] Add frustum culling
- [ ] Logger
